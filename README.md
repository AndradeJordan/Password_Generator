# Project Summary: Password Generator

The *"Password Generator"* project, implemented in **C#**, is a simple tool designed to create random passwords based on user preferences. 
The program prompts the user to specify the desired *length of the password* and *the number of passwords* to generate. 
Additionally, the user can choose the type of characters to include in the password: 
- **lowercase letters only,**
- **lowercase and uppercase letters,**
- **letters and numbers,**
- **a combination of characters, numbers, and special characters.**

# 
Upon receiving the user's input, the program generates ***the requested number of passwords according to the specified criteria and displays them to the user***. 
This project demonstrates basic concepts of C# programming such as user input handling, random password generation, and conditional logic within a console-based application.
